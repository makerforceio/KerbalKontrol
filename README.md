# KerbalKontrol
A project intended for display at the Singapore MakerFaire 2017. Last year, we built a Kerbal Space Program controller, that very much resembles a arcade machine. This was done through embedded the monitor into the frame itself, which gives the entire machine a good bit more authenticity. In fact, you can read the article we wrote on that [here](https://makerforce.io/the-ksp-command-station-2/). We were also fortunate to be featured on [Hackaday](http://hackaday.com/2016/07/25/diy-command-station-for-kerbal-space-program-is-overkill/).
So this year, we've decided to improve on the previous version with a much better documented system with a better designed architecture, both software and hardware wise. Expect this README to fill up with more stuff as it becomes necessary to add more documentation so other people can replicate the work.
